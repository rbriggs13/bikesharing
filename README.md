# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not opening up a bike sharing company is feasible in Des Moines, Iowa. This is done by examing the data from the month of August from a similar company in NYC. The visualizations used for this analysis can be found here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.briggs/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_16381151297850/Citibike_Challenge?publish=yes)
## Results
### Visualization 1
The first visualization is a simple pie graph showing the breakdown of single use customers and people who suscribe to the bike share service. This shows an overwhelming amount of customers subscribe to the service, this is a good thing as Des Moines wouldn't have as many tourists as NYC, the demographic that would make up most of the single use customers.
### Visualization 2
The second visualization shows the amount of bikes taken at each hour of the day, starting with midnight and ending at 11 PM. This graph shows that the peak hours are in the late afternoon from around 5 PM to 7 PM. This shows that most people using the share service at this time are most likely commuters returning from work.
### Visualization 3
The third visualization shows that the vast majority of the bikes are used for less than an hour, with barely any going over an hour. This is good as it would allow new people to quickly gain access to a bike.
### Visualization 4
The fourth visualization is the same as the previous one, except broken down by gender. This visualization shows that all the genders use the bikes for roughly the same amount of time, however there are much more male users.
### Visualization 5
The fifth visualization is a heat map showing the amount of bikes being used at each hour, broken down by days of the week. This shows that along with the previous peak hours 8-9 AM is busy as well, with Thursday being the busiest day. The weekends also have more bike usage around midday whereas the week days are busier around communting hours.
### Visualization 6
The sixth visualization is the same as the previous one, except divided by gender. This heat map again shows that men are the primary users of the bike share system.
### Visualization 7
The final visualization is a heat map showing the amount of bikes being used on the days of the week, broken down by both gender and whether the person is a subscriber or a one off customer. This data indicates that the subscribers use the bikes more during the weekday, while the non-subscribers are mostly using the service on the weekends.
## Summary
The biggest take away from all of these visualizations is that the majority of the customers of this service are people commuting to and from work every day, most of which are surely subscribers. This is a very reliable customer base that could exist in Des Moines. The least profitable part of the service is the tourists using the system, which wouldn't really happen in Des Moines. However it doesn't matter as the vast majority of people will be people who live in the area. A few recommended visualizations for future analyses would be the most popular areas of Des Moines in order to determine the best place to put more bikes, as well as the amount of commuting males vs commuting females as the males use the bike share service to a much higher degree.
